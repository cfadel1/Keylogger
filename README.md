# Windows Keylogger

This is a Console Application done using C++. This application has the capability of capturing keystrokes using system hooks.  These keystrokes are then encrypted and logged into a file in a hidden directory on the PC. The logs files are then emailed to the user after a certain amount of time using an auto generated PowerShell script. Then the same application is capable of decrypting the log files.
